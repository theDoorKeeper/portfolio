            <p>Hi , I'm Chakib  a self taught front end develloper , currenctly spesialized in React and still learning , planning to go full stack using NodeJS ,
                I discovered a passion in programming , and decided to drop out to continue on this road , i love learning new concepts ,applying them , solving problems,
